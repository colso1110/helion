# DCN Playbooks that are to run before doing neutron upgrade.


# Hlm-deploy upgrades nova before neutron. Since the deployment of DCN-VRS,
# DCN-VRSG, and DCN-MDA took place after nova-deploy, they should be
# upgraded after nova upgrade as well.
#
# Doing the DCN-VRS, DCN-VRS-G, and DCN-MDA upgrade here means that the
# upgrade of DCN-ML2, and DCN-CORE-PLUGIN can be done from this hook
# as well.
