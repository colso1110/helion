  disk-models:
  - name: SWPAC-DISKS

    # This example is based on using a single 1TB disk for a volume
    # group that contains all file systems on a controller with 64GB
    # of memory.
    #
    # Swift account & container rings consume a second physical disk
    # Additional disks can be added to the 'physical-volumes' section.
    #
    #

    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5

        # At least 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
