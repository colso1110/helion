# Usage:
# If the storage input model is not being used specify the index of the host
# which will run the Cinder volume and backup services in the cinder control
# plane specific fact file. The fact files for each control plane are on the
# lifecycle-manager in the /etc/ansible/facts.d directory. Each fact file
# should only contain the index number of the host which will run the
# Cinder volume and backup services. The host index numbers can be obtained
# by running the cinder-show-volume-hosts.yml playbook.
#
# If the storage input model is being used specify the assignment of backends
# to hosts in the /etc/ansible/facts.d/cinder_backend_assignment.fact file.
# The assignment should be specified in json format as follows:
#{
#  "<BACKEND_NAME>": "<HOSTNAME>",
#  "<BACKEND_NAME>": "<HOSTNAME>",
#  "<BACKEND_NAME>": "<HOSTNAME>",
#  "<BACKEND_NAME>": "<HOSTNAME>"
#}
# After the relevant fact file(s) have been edited run the cinder migration
# playbook as follows:
#   ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cinder-migrate-volume.yml \
#   --limit=<LIMIT_PATTERN>
# where LIMIT_PATTERN is the pattern used to limit the hosts selected to a
# specific control plane. The cinder-migrate-volume.yml has to be run for
# each control plane where migrations are needed.


# Verify that the specified host index is valid before
# performing migrate
