# This playbook performs a Tempest run against a deployed cloud. It is not
# executed as part of HLM deploy. It is instead triggered indipendently either
# by CI, or by an user of the deployed cloud.

# This playbook aims to return the cloud to the same state it was before tests
# were executed. To achieve this it will create test resources, update the
# configuration, run the tests, archive the test results, and cleanup the
# test resources initially created.

# some stuff needs to be run on cluster member to have access
# to CP output.

# Set-up tempest resource phoney test nodes for parrellel run.
