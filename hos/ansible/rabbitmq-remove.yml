# This will remove all RabbitMQ components installed by this playbook.
- hosts: FND-RMQ
  max_fail_percentage: 0
  roles:
    - guard-cluster
    - iptables
    - rabbitmq
  tasks:
    # We want to ensure that all IP chains related to Rabbit
    # are torn down at the end of this part of the remove process.
    # However, the iptables-{add,delete} rules have an asymmetry:
    # -add is idempotent (can be called multiple times), but
    # -delete will flag an error if the named chain does not exist.
    # (This design is to catch the maximal number of errors arising
    # during the composition of multipler playbooks that may play
    # with the firewall settings.)
    # Therefore, to manage the remove situation where an attempt to
    # upgrade a broken Rabbit installation has failed (potentially
    # leaving a firewall rule in place), we unconditionally add
    # the rules here so that we guarantee it is safe to attempt
    # to remove them at the end of the tear-down process.
