# Mark the "hlm_notify_ceph_restart_required" variable for clearing from the
# persistent fact cache. This variable is needed in each of the individual
# services MON, OSD and RGW start tasks, so we hold off on marking it for
# clearing until these start tasks have run. The "is defined" check will mark
# the variable for clearing at the end of the play or else at the beginning
# of the next play.
