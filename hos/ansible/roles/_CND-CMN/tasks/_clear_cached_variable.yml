# Mark the hlm_notify_cinder_restart_required variable for clearing from the
# persistent fact cache. This variable is needed in each of the individual
# services start tasks so we hold off on marking it for clearing until after
# these start tasks have run. The "is defined" check will mark the variable
# for clearing at the end of the play or else at the beginning of the next
# play.
