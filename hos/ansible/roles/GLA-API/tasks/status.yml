# depending on whether the glance-api is enabled on a particular
# node. If ha_mode is false then the glance-api should only
# be enabled (running) on the first node. We check that the api is enabled
# on all nodes it should be enabled on. We also check that the
# glance-api is disabled (not running) on all nodes it should be disabled on.
