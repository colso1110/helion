      Conflicting mappings were found in the Elasticsearch indices.  To correct

      preserve all data run the separate playbook
      kronos-elasticsearch-migrate.yml note though that this operation may take
      a significate amount of time to complete depending on the number and size
      of your indices (e.g. days).
