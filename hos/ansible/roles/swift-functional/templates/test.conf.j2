# Instructions:
#
# - Checkout swift repo on a test server
#
# - Copy this file to /tmp/test.conf
#
# - If you have SSL cert setup, edit the "insecure" option below
#
# - Test your general environment as follows:
#
#   (a) Copy the /tmp/swift_functional.osrc to your test server
#       and run it (this edits /etc/hosts and rewrites no_proxy
#       environment variable)
#
#   (b) Use swift CLI as follows. Remove the --insecure if you gave setup
#       SSL certs.
#
#       swift --insecure stat -v
#
#       You should expect it to show the account metadata. The -v means it
#       also prints the Swift endpoint and token.
#
# - In top level swift directory, run the following commands to run the
#   functional tests:
#       export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:A true SSLContext object is not available,ignore:Unverified HTTPS request is being made"
#       tox -e func
#
[func_test]

# Functional tests do not support endpoint type -- hence
# we use the external VIP for auth since we use the external
# endpoint anyway.

# For /etc/hosts:-   {{ auth_ip }}   {{ auth.hostname }}

# Change this if using certs
