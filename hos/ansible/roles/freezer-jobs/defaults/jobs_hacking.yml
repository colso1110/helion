# When adding a new job, it it necessary to assign it to specific nodes in _freezer_manage_jobs.yml
# This is how you define which server should execute which backup in function of their role:
#
#- hosts: <which ansible role should execute this job, use FRE-AGN to target all>
#  roles:
#    - freezer-jobs
#  tasks:
#    - include: roles/freezer-jobs/tasks/_manage_job.yml job_name=<job_name>
#
#jobs:
#  <job_name>:
#    # [mandatory] If the job should be created
#    enabled: <true or false> #If the job should be created
#
#    # [mandatory] If the job should be created to store its backup in swift
#    store_to_swift: <true or false>
#
#    # [mandatory] If the job should be created to store its backup to an SSH server. The job won't be created if valid ssh credentials aren't provided in ssh_credentials.yml
#    store_to_ssh: <true or false>
#
#    # [mandatory] If the job should be created to store its backup localy, require you to set local_storage_base_dir as well
#    store_to_local: <true or false>
#
#    #The base directory to store backups to when using storage_local
#    local_storage_base_dir: <path>
#
#    # [mandatory] If we should create matching restore jobs
#    also_create_restore_job: <true or false>
#
#    # [mandatory] Name of the container to store backup to.
#    container: freezer_lifecycle_manager_backup
#
#    # [mandatory] Repeat the backup every <value>
#    schedule: <"n hours|minutes|days">
#
#    actions: # The order of your actions matters, they will be executed in the specified order.
#
#        # [mandatory] Name of the backup
#      - backup_name: <name>
#
#        # [mandatory] Path to backup
#        backup_path: <path>
#
#        # Path to restore the backup when using also_create_restore_job
#        restore_path: <path>
#
#        # Any valid freezer-agent option to pass to the freezer agent when executing the backup
#        backup_options:
#          <option1_name> : <option1_value>
#          <option2_name> : <option2_value>
#
#        # Any valid freezer-agent option to pass to the freezer agent when executing the restore
#        restore_options:
#          <option1_name> : <option1_value>
#          <option2_name> : <option2_value>
#
#        # Number of time to retry the action if it fails [defaults 5]
#        max_retries: <int>
#
#        # Amount of time in seconds to wait between retries [defaults 60]
#        max_retries_interval: <int>
#
#
#
#
# For example:
#
#  foo:
#    enabled: true
#    storage_swift: true
#    storage_ssh: true
#    storage_local: false
#    also_create_restore_job: true
#    container: foo_container
#    schedule: "24 hours"
#    actions:
#      - backup_name: action_1
#        backup_path: /home/user1/
#        restore_path: /tmp/user1_restore/
#        backup_options:
#          snapshot: true
#          max_level: 15
#        max_retries_interval: 2
#        max_retries_interval: 10
#      - backup_name: action_2
#        backup_path: /etc/passwd
#        restore_path: /etc/
#        restore_options:
#          max_priority: true
#          overwrite: true
#
#
# Then the _freezer_manage_jobs.yml needs to be edited to add this.
#
#- hosts: NOV-CMP:&FRE-AGN     # only on compute node, Don't forget to add ":&FRE-AGN" to the role name
#  roles:
#    - freezer-jobs
#  tasks:
#    - include: roles/freezer-jobs/tasks/_manage_job.yml job_name=foo
