# Removing the swift monasca_agent_plugin in favour of the individual httpcheck
# plugins for the swift proxy, account, container and object services. Also,
# the swiftlm_scan plugin has a process check for all swift processes and so
# it is used in favour of the swift monasca_agent_plugin.
# The name value here is the name of Plugin class in the detect modules, not
# the name of the module.
