# This task checks that a deployment does not try to use both jinja2 and the 
# storage input model to configure backends. The test is that if the directory
# helion/my_cloud/definition/data/cinder/ exists, then there should be no
# backends enabled in cinder.conf.j2
- name: CND-VOL | validate-config | Cannot mix input model and jinja2 configs
