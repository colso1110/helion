  # Handle Upgrade Issues
  #
  # In HOS 3.0, builder files were in /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-<region-name>
  # In HOS 4.0, they are in /etc/swiftlm/<cloud>/<control-plane>/builder_dir
  # Copy the files from the old to new location -- and from now on, ring changes
  # are based on the new location.
  # We don't delete the builder files in the old location (just in case something
  # goes wrong).

  # The "removes" here is effective after the rename task.
  # The rename below is an optimisation, since rsync --update means that
  # an old builder_dir will not overwrite the latest builder_dir files.
  # DO NOT refactor to use rsync module. It cannot be used for this action
