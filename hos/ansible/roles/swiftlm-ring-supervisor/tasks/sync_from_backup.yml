# If the builder node is reimaged, we need the latest version of the builder
# files so that subsequent ring builds work correctly. We need to ignore
# errors here since during initial deploy, there is no backup copy. Also,
# we don't want a play to stop on *this* node because a backup node is down.
# DO NOT refactor to use rsync module. It cannot be used for this action
