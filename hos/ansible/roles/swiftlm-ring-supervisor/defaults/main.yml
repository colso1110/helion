# We perform builds on SWF-ACC[0]. However, we make backups on all
# SWF_ACC nodes for two reasons:
# - allows deploy of latest rings even if SWF-ACC[0] is down
# - allows the definition of SWF-ACC[0] to change (e.g., when a cluster
#   is added to the model).
# We need the network-hostnames where rsync runs - hence use consumes relationship
