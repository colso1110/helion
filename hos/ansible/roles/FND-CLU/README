Include:
  - haproxy - for load balancing
  - keepalived - for managing VIPs for haproxy

Pre-reqs:
  - haproxy user     - may be installed by haproxy package
  - haproxy group    - may be installed by haproxy package

Questions/Comments:
  - If chroot is used how to log to syslog and access stats socket
  - Is it necessary to be able to run more than one instance of haproxy
  - logging will need to be done to somewhere compatible with central logging
  - Each node participating in a single cluster should use a different priority
    in keepalived.conf
  - Should we be using an authentication block in keepalived.conf?

TODO: Fix race in haproxy startup. Need to sleep somewhere - it is being
restarted too soon. SJH - is this still relevant?
