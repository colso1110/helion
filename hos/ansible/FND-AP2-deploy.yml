# This is commented out as we remove apache start from deploy. This seems a bit
# odd but after intitial deploy there is no apache configuration in place and
# therefore apache cannot be started. The first service in should therefore
# start apache instead of it being started here.
#
# Start depends on a notification from above
# split it out to make sure the handler fires first
