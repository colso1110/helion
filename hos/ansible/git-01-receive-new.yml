# Receive a new HOS code drop

# (a) create new commit on the hos branch
# This works identically with the first and subsequent drops, assuming initialisation is complete.
# clone the hos branch to a working directory.
# replace its contents with an exploded helion/ directory from the new deployment.
# create a commit that accepts all the new stuff (be sure to delete any unwanted old files)
# push this back to ~/helion (hos branch)

# (b) merge site and hos tips
# in ~/helion, triger a git commit to the site branch of the hos branch.
# The user may need to massage this merge (using the usual git tooling) as appropriate.
