<h2 id="helion-entry-scale-cloud-with-vsa-example">Helion Entry Scale Cloud with VSA Example</h2>
<p>The input files in this example deploy a cloud that has the following characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="control-planes">Control Planes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Core cluster: Runs Core OpenStack Services, (e.g. keystone, nova api, glance api, neutron api, horizon, heat api). Default configuration is two nodes of role type CONTROLLER-ROLE</p></li>
<li><p>Metering &amp; Monitoring cluster: Runs the OpenStack Services for metering &amp; monitoring (e.g. celiometer, monasca &amp; logging). Default configuration is three nodes of role type MTRMON-ROLE</p></li>
<li><p>Database &amp; Message Queue Cluster: Runs clustered MySQL and RabbitMQ services to support the Helion cloud infrastructure. Default configuration is three nodes of role type DBMQ-ROLE. Three nodes are required for high availability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resource-pools">Resource Pools</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>One compute Node</p></li>
<li><p>Three VSA Nodes</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional resource nodes can be added to the configuration.</em></p>
<p><em>Minimal Swift Resources are provided by the control plane</em></p>
<h3 id="deployer-node">Deployer Node</h3>
<p>This configuration runs the lifecycle-manager (formerly referred to as the deployer) on a control plane node. You need to include this node address in your servers.yml definition. This function does not need a dedicated network.</p>
<p>An example set of servers are defined in <strong><em>data/servers.yml</em></strong>. You will need to modify this file to reflect your specific environment.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>The example requires the following networks:</p>
<p>IPMI/iLO network, connected to the deployer and the IPMI/iLO ports of all servers</p>
<p>A pair of bonded NICs which are used by the following networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>External API - This is the network that users will use to make requests to the cloud</li>
<li>External VM - This is the network that will be used to provide access to VMs (via floating IP addresses)</li>
<li>Guest - This is the network that will carry traffic between VMs on private networks within the cloud</li>
<li>Cloud Management - This is the network that will be used for all internal traffic between the cloud services. This network is also used to install and configure the nodes and for iSCSI traffic as well. This network needs to be on an untagged VLAN</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the EXTERNAL_API network must be reachable from the EXTERNAL_VM network if you want VMs to be able to make API calls to the cloud.</p>
<p>An example set of networks are defined in <strong><em>data/networks.yml</em></strong>. You will need to modify this file to reflect your environment.</p>
<p>The example uses the devices hed3 &amp; hed4 as a bonded network for all services. If you need to modify these for your environment they are defined in <strong><em>data/net_interfaces.yml</em></strong> The network devices eth3 &amp; eth4 are renamed to devices hed4 &amp; hed5 using the PCI bus mappings secified in <strong><em>data/nic_mappings.yml</em></strong>. You may need to modify the PCI bus addresses to match your system.</p>
<h3 id="local-storage">Local Storage</h3>
<p>All servers should present a single OS disk, protected by a RAID controller. This disk needs to be at least 600GB in capacity. VSA appliance deployed on a host is expected to consume ~40 GB of disk space from host root disk for ephemeral storage to run VSA VM. In addition the example configures additional disks depending on the role of the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Controllers: /dev/sdb ind /dev/sdc are configured to be used by Swift</li>
<li>DBMQ Controllers: /dev/sdb is configured as an additional Volume group to be used by MySQl and RabbitMQ</li>
<li>Compute Severs: /dev/sdb is configured as an additional Volume Group to be used for VM storage</li>
<li>VSA Servers: /dev/sdc is configured for VSA data storage and /dev/sdb is configured for VSA cache (required only for adaptive-optimization)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that VSA can be deployed with adaptive optimization (AO) or without AO. AO allows built-in storage tiering for VSA. It is recommended to use SSD disk for AO.</p>
<p><em>Additional disks can be configured for any of these roles by editing the corresponding </em><strong>data/disks_<em>.yml</em></strong> file</p>
