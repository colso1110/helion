    # /dev/sda_root is used as a Volume Group for /, /var/log, and /var/crash
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
    volume-groups:
    # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
    # 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.

    # Additional disk group defined for Swift

    # Only list disks that are present at deployment time.
    # Note, with the default Erasure Code configuration i.e. 10 fragments
    # and 4 parity, a minimum of 14 disks are required for the EC ring. With
    # 3 object servers, need a minimum of 5 disks per server.
