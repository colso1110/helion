    #
    # External API
    #
    # This is the network group that users will use to
    # access the public API endpoints of your cloud
    #
    - name: EXTERNAL-API
      hostname-suffix: extapi
      component-endpoints:
        - powerdns-ext

      load-balancers:
        - provider: ip-cluster
          name: extlb
          # If external-name is set then public urls in keystone
          # will use this name instead of the IP address
          #You must either set this to a name that can be resolved in your network
          # or comment out this line to use IP addresses
          external-name:
          tls-components:
            - default
          roles:
            - public
          cert-file: my-public-mid-scale-kvm-vsa-cert
          # This is the name of the certificate that will be used on load balancer.
          # HOS will look for a file with this name in the config/tls/certs directory.
          # This is the certificate that matches your setting for external-name
          #
          # Note that it is also possible to have per service certificates:
          #
          # cert-file:
          # default: my-public-mid-scale-kvm-vsa-cert
          # horizon: my-horizon-cert
          # nova-api: my-nova-cert
          #
          # The configuration-processor will also create a request templates for each
          # named certificates under
          # "info/cert_reqs/"
          #
          # And this will be of the form
          #
          # info/cert_reqs/my-public-mid-scale-kvm-vsa-cert
          # info/cert_reqs/my-horizon-cert
          # info/cert_reqs/my-nova-cert
          #
          # These request templates contain the subject Alt-names that
          # the certificates need. A customer can add to this template
          # before generating their Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
          # They would then send the CSR to their CA to be signed and
          # receive the certificate, which can then be dropped into
          # "config/tls/certs".
          #
          # When you bring in your own certificate you may want to bring
          # in the trust chains (or CA certificate) for this certificate.
          # This is usually not required if the CA is a public signer that
          # gets bundled by the system. However, we suggest you include it
          # into HOS anyway by copying the file into the directory
          # "config/cacerts/".
          # Note that the file extension should be .crt or it will not
          # be processed by HOS.

    # External VM
    #
    # This is the network group that will be used to provide
    # external access to VMs (via floating IP Addresses)
    #
    - name: EXTERNAL-VM
      tags:
        - neutron.l3_agent.external_network_bridge


    #
    # GUEST
    #
    # This is the network group that will be used to provide
    # private networks to VMs
    #
    - name: GUEST
      hostname-suffix: guest
      tags:
        - neutron.networks.vxlan

      # To specify a specific set of vxlan IDs change the above to
      #  - neutron.networks.vxlan:
      #      tenant-vxlan-id-range: "1000:2000,3000:3500"

      # Set the mtu to 1550 to allow VMs to use a 1500 MTU without
      # underlying packet fragmentation.
      # Note: this requires setting a 1550 mtu (or higher) on any
      # untagged network group on the same interface as GUEST so
      # the MANAGEMENT network group must also have the mtu set to at
      # least 1550. But this example also sets the ISCSI network
      # group to 9000 so in this case the MANAGEMENT network group mtu
      # must be set to 9000 to accommodate the large ISCSI mtu setting.
      #
      #mtu: 1550

    # Internal API

    # This is the network group that users will use to

          cert-file: helion-internal-cert
          # The helion-internal-cert is a reserved name and
          # this certificate will be autogenerated. Customer
          # can bring in their own cert with a different name
          # and follow the process described for the external
          # loadbalancer configuration above. See under
          # my-public-mid-scale-kvm-vsa-cert.
          # It is important to use the request
          # template generated by the config processor as there
          # are more Subject Alt-name entries for the internal
          # certificate than the external certificate.
