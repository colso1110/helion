</dl>
<p><b>Node roles</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Control Plane, includes Deployer node (3 nodes)</li>
  <li>Ironic Compute (just 1 node)</li>
</ul>

<p>This cloud model requires the following networks:</p>
<p>IMPI/iLO network, connected to the deployer and the IPMI/iLO ports of all physical servers.</p>
<p>A pair of bonded NICs which are used by the following networks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>External API - This is the network that users will use to make requests to the cloud</li>
  <li>Guest - This is the network that will carry traffic between Baremetal instances on private networks within the cloud</li>
  <li>Cloud Management - This is the network that will be used for all internal traffic between the cloud services</li>
</ul>
